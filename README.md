# Campaign Dashboard

A React-based project to manage and display campaigns by dividing them into three categories: **Upcoming Campaigns**, **Live Campaigns**, and **Past Campaigns**. The application also supports language translation between English (`en`) and Spanish (`es`) using the `i18n` framework.

---

## Features

- **Campaign Categories**:
  - **Upcoming Campaigns**: Campaigns with a `createdOn` date after today (future dates).
  - **Live Campaigns**: Campaigns with a `createdOn` date equal to today's date.
  - **Past Campaigns**: Campaigns with a `createdOn` date before today.
- When a campaign's date is rescheduled, it should automatically move to the relevant tab. Ensure this functionality works consistently.
- **Multilingual Support**:
  - Language toggle between English (`en`) and Spanish (`es`).
  - Translation files are located in the `src/i18n` folder.

- **Well-structured Code**:
  - Clean, modular, and scalable architecture.
